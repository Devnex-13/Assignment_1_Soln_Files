# Assignment 3 Solution:
# Task 1 Solution:
Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
Program that:
Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
Returns the calculated factorial.
Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.
 
# Expected Output:
For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

# Task 2 Solution:
Using the Math Module for Calculations
 
Program that:
Asks the user for a number as input.
Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
3.   Displays the calculated results.

# Expected Output:
For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:
Enter a number:25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303
